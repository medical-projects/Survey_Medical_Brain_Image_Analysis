# Survey_Medical_Brain_Image_Analysis
A Survey on Deep Learning methods in Medical Brain Image Analysis

Automatic brain segmentation from MR images has become one of the major areas of medical research. Deep learning algorithms, specially convolutional
neural networks (CNN), have been widely used for determining the exact location, orientation, and area of the lesion. This survey provides an overview of CNN-based
approaches used for brain image segmentation. We describe and compare several state-of-the-art techniques for improving segmentation accuracy and performance.
